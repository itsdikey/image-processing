applying mean filter with radius 2 after using binary filter results in a mess ❌
apply median after applying the binary filter makes beatiful blobs while removing unnesecary details ✔
applying median before applying binary filter results in better contrasted regions ✔
applying median and then mean results and then  in nice result ✔
gaussian filter with radii 5 and then binary filter results in pretty interesting results, but there is detoriation on some sides ✔❌
gaussian filter with radii 2 and then binary filter results in pretty interesting results, with reduced deteriation ✔
applying mean filter with radius 2 then gaussian filter with radius 2 results in pretty nice contours ✔
