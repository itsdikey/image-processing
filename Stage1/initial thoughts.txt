1) applying mean filter with radius 2 then using binary filter has good results ✔
2) applying mean filter with radius 2 after using binary filter results in a mess ❌
3) apply median after applying the binary filter makes beatiful blobs while removing unnesecary details ✔
4) applying median before applying binary filter results in better contrasted regions ✔
5) applying median and then mean and then binary filter results in nice result ✔
6) gaussian filter with radii 5 and then binary filter results in pretty interesting results, but there is detoriation on some sides ✔❌
7) gaussian filter with radii 2 and then binary filter results in pretty interesting results, with reduced deteriation ✔
8) applying mean filter with radius 2 then gaussian filter with radius 2 results in pretty nice contours ✔
9) reapplying median after all those fillters seems to significantly improve results ✔
